# Fix for Logout Issue in Gerobaks App

## Problem
When users logged out of the app, their account data was completely removed from localStorage, causing them to be unable to log back in using the same account.

## Solution
We've made the following changes to fix this issue:

1. **Modified the Logout Process**:
   - Updated the `logout` method in `LocalStorageService` to preserve user data
   - Changed the logout behavior to only update login status flags instead of deleting user data

2. **Enhanced Login Functionality**:
   - Ensured login methods explicitly set the login flag to true
   - Added additional debugging to track the login/logout process
   - Made the code more robust in handling existing user data

3. **Added Auto-Login Capability**:
   - Created `AuthHelper` utility class for authentication tasks
   - Implemented auto-login functionality to use saved credentials
   - Updated the splash screen to attempt auto-login before proceeding

4. **Key Code Changes**:
   - Modified `LocalStorageService.logout()` to preserve user data
   - Enhanced `UserService.logout()` to properly handle state changes
   - Added proper login flag management throughout the authentication flow
   - Created `AuthHelper` for centralized authentication utilities

## Benefits
- Users can now log out and log back in without losing their account data
- The app provides a smoother authentication experience
- Auto-login provides convenience for returning users
- Better error handling and debugging throughout the authentication flow

## Testing
To test this fix:
1. Create a new account or login with existing credentials
2. Use the app normally
3. Logout from the profile page
4. Attempt to login again with the same credentials
5. The login should succeed and you should be able to access your account
