# Gerobaks App Updates

## 1. Custom Dialog Implementation

We've implemented a unified custom dialog system throughout the app:

- Created `AppDialogMixin` to provide consistent dialog methods across app pages
- Updated sign-up pages to use the custom dialogs
- Added helper utilities for managing dialogs
- Ensured all error and success messages use the branded dialog style

We've improved the user registration flow to ensure user data persists properly:

- Enhanced user registration process in `SignUpBatch4Page` to properly register users
- Fixed data flow between registration pages and subscription selection
- Improved sign-in/sign-up process to maintain consistent user data
- Added better debugging information to identify and fix data persistence issues
- Ensured profile pictures and user data are properly saved

## 3. Data Management Improvements

We've enhanced the overall data management architecture:

- Created a `ProfileController` to centralize user data management
- Improved `LocalStorageService` to handle user data storage more consistently
